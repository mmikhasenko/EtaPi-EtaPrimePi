# EtaPi/Eta'Pi coupled-channel model
Determination of the lightest hybrid meson pole

The project has been completed and published in [Phys.Rev.Lett. 122 (2019) 4, 042002](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1697661)

The repository contains the [julia](http://julialang.org/) implementation of the reaction amplitude for
the $\eta\pi/ \eta'\pi$ coupled-channel model for the P and D waves.
